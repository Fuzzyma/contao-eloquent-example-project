#ContaoEloquentExampleProject

Example project for the use of eloquent models in contao

## Installation

```bash
composer create-project fuzzyma/contao-eloquent-example-project exampleProject
app/console contao:setup
```

The `app/console contao:setup` is provided from the
[fuzzyma/contao-database-commands-bundle](https://github.com/Fuzzyma/contao-database-commands-bundle)
and does the work from the install tool. This bundle is already required by the example project which makes the
command accessible.
